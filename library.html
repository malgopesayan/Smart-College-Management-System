   <p>
      i. Users must check the Accession Number(s) and due date of the book(s) issued by them before leaving the
      Circulation counters to avoid confusion in future. Any discrepancy will not be considered afterwards. <br>

      ii. Library Membership Identity Cards and borrowed books are not transferable and hence should not be lent to
      others. <br>

      iii. Users are liable for the damage and loss of books, if any <br>

      transaction is over at the counter. Discrepancy if any should be brought to the notice of the counter person
      immediately. Any complaint thereafter is not likely to be entertained.

      book otherwise recall notice will be issued from library. </p>

   <p>All outstanding dues in form of delay fine or lost book must be cleared within the current academic year failing

      application.
